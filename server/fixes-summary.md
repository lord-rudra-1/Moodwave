# MoodWave Application Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Song Playback Issues
- **Problem**: Songs were not playing in the application
- **Cause**: Some song files were just placeholders (very small files, ~4KB)
- **Solution**: Identified and replaced 30 placeholder files with actual MP3 files

### 2. Missing Cover Images
- **Problem**: Cover images were not displaying for songs
- **Cause**: Songs in the database didn't have the `coverImage` field assigned
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated all 50 songs with appropriate cover images based on their mood tags
  - Added `coverImage` field to the Song schema
  - Assigned cover images using the mapping:
    - Happy: happy-cover.jpg
    - Sad: sad-cover.jpg
    - Energetic: energy-cover.jpg
    - Calm: peaceful-cover.jpg
    - Romantic: love-cover.jpg
    - Melancholic: melancholic-cover.jpg
    - Chill: chill-cover.jpg

## Changes Made

1. **Created Scripts**:
   - `check-file-sizes.js`: Identified and replaced small placeholder files
   - `fix-song-covers.js`: Added cover images to each song based on mood tags
   - `update-missing-covers.js`: Fixed schema issues with coverImage field
   - `check-audio-files.js`: Verified audio files exist and are properly linked

2. **Database Updates**:
   - Added `coverImage` field to all 50 songs
   - Updated Song schema to include `coverImage` by default
   - Fixed file paths for audio files

3. **File System Updates**:

   - Kept all 7 cover images, one for each mood category

## Next Steps
